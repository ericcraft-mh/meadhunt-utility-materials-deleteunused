# Mead & Hunt Delete Unused Materials

### Inspiration
Delete Unused Materials was created based on a request from the Omniverse forums: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/is-there-a-built-in-way-to-remove-unused-materials/220588

It also provided me a chance to learning Python, USD, and Kit APIs/workflows.

### About
This tool was created so users can Delete Unused Materials from the scene. When new materials are applied to an object the old one remains in the scene. The tool skips materials in References and Payloads as they can only be deleted in the original file.

### Usage
After installation the dialog can be opened by Right-Clicking in the Stage > Delete Unused Materials.
